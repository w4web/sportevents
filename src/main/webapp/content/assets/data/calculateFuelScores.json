Your Fuel score shows you how much - as a percentage of your body weight - your balance was disturbed. Did you stay below 1%? Congratulations, you stayed in balance! Did you go over 1%? Drinking more will be the way to train and recover more effectively. Warning: You can keep your weight up only by eating on the road, but your fluid balance will then be heavily disturbed.</p>"
