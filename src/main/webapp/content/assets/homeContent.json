With Fuel, you can map your own sweat rate. Fuel then gives you personal advice for training sessions and races, based on your own sweat rate and energy needs. </p><p> Knowledge is power! Fuel will help you to train healthy and perform optimally by employing the Fuel2Endure motto: “Enter the training session balanced out, exit the training session balanced out.”This way, Fuel will help you to make it to the start- and finishline of your event in a healthy state.
